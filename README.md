# Fold N' Cut
This is an implementation of the [Straight Skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_skeleton) method for the [Fold and Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold-and-cut_theorem) problem, which is not a general solution, as there are [cases where it fails](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.5310/spring25/lectures/L06.html?notes=3&images=14).

ðŸ”§The app is currently under development - stay tuned!ðŸ”§

I created this webapp while taking Professor Erik Demaine's class, [Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, Polyhedra](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.5310/spring25/)  in the spring semester of 2025.
